You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and trade. You own some factories, each factory contains some converters, each converter receives some resources and produces some resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to get more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You can run factories to produce resources.
  - You can only run a converter once in a turn.
  - You must run factories simultaneously. That means you must prepare all needed resources for all factories you want to run in advance.
Your final goal is to be the richest player.
Here are introduction of resources:
And as suggesting, each item has a estimated value, you can use it to estimate the value of the item to help you make trade decision.
Note that the value is only a rough estimation, and you should not rely on it too much:
Food, Industry and Culture, sometimes called "small block", each has a estimated value of 1
Biotech, Energy, Information, sometimes called "big block", each has a estimated value of 1.5
Ship has a estimated value of 1, and its value is very changeable.
Hypertech, Score, each has a estimated value of 3.
WildSmall may replace any small block as input item, and WildBig may replace any big block as input item.
w and W each has a value of 1, but sometimes they may become more valuable.
ArbitrarySmall and ArbitraryBig are only used to describe the converter's input. It means you can use any small block or big block as input item.

Now is the bidding stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions and the plan you designed below, please make bid actions for this turn.
Plan you designed is in ### Plan. All actions you may take are listed in ### Actions.

Bidding Rules:
1. Allocation: You must decide how to distribute your available ships between the 'Colony' bid and the 'Technology' bid. You can bid 0 on a track.
2. Priority: In each track, players with higher bids select items first.
3. Capacity Limit: Your bid amount acts as a budget cap. You cannot select an item with a value higher than the number of ships you bid for that track, even if it is your turn to pick.
4. Payment & Refund: 
   - If you pick an item: You pay your FULL BID AMOUNT. Any excess ships (Bid - Item Value) are NOT returned.
   - If you pick nothing: Your full bid is returned to you.
5. Tie breaker: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.

You need to allocate your Ships to bid on Colonies and Research Teams.
Review the available cards in the auction tracks and your current ship count carefully.
Take into account the number of colonies and research teams you already possess, also the species' tie-breaker value according to the tie breaker rules.
Your Total Bid (colony_bid + research_bid) must not exceed your currently held Ships.
