You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and negotiation. You own factories, each containing converters. Each converter consumes specific input resources and produces specific output resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains the following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must create a plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to unlock more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You run factories to produce resources.
  - Each converter can be run only once per turn.
  - All factories run simultaneously. You must possess all required input resources for all planned factories before the production stage begins.
Your goal is to have the "Highest Score" at the end of the game.

Resource Valuation Guide:
Each resource has an estimated value to help you make trading decisions. These are rough estimates and situational:
- Food, Industry, Culture ("small blocks"): ~1 value each.
- Biotech, Energy, Information ("big blocks"): ~1.5 value each.
- Ship: ~1 value (highly variable).
- Hypertech, Score: ~3 value. Score is the victory condition and has no other utility.
- WildSmall: Can replace any small block input. Value > 1.
- WildBig: Can replace any big block input. Value > 1.5.
- ArbitrarySmall / ArbitraryBig: Terms used in converter descriptions meaning "any small block" or "any big block".

Now is the bidding stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions and the plan you designed below, please make bid actions for this turn.
Plan you designed is in ### Plan. All actions you may take are listed in ### Actions.

Bidding Rules:

1. Allocation: 
You must decide how to distribute your available ships between the 'Colony' track and the 'Technology' track. You may bid 0 on a track. You may NOT exceed your total available ships when combining bids for both tracks. You may keep some ships unbid if you choose.
2. Priority: 
In each track, players with higher bids select items first. Regardless of your bid amount, you may select only one item per track.
3. Capacity Limit: 
You cannot select an item with a value higher than the number of ships you bid for that track. (i.e., Your bid must be at least equal to the minimum cost of the item you wish to acquire.)
4. Payment & Refund: 
  - If you pick an item: You pay your FULL BID AMOUNT. Any excess ships (Bid minus Item Value) are NOT returned.
  - If you pick nothing: Your full bid is returned to you.
5. Tie Breaker: 
In both bidding rounds, if two or more players tie by bidding the same number of ships, the player who currently possesses fewer cards of that type (Colonies or Technologies) chooses first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
6. Advices:
  - Try to bid a colony if possible, as colonies provide ongoing benefits.
  - Holding too many research teams is not recommended. One or two research teams are usually sufficient unless you have many (10x or more) resources to spend on research.

You need to allocate your Ships to bid on Colonies and Research Teams.
First, decide the total number of ships you want to spend. This number MUST NOT exceed the number of ships you currently hold. If you do not hold any ships, you must bid 0 for both track.
Then, distribute these ships between the Colony track and the Research Team track.
Review the available cards in the auction tracks and your current ship count carefully.
Take into account the number of colonies and research teams you already possess, also the species' tie-breaker value according to the tie breaker rules.
Your Total Bid (colony_bid + research_bid) must not exceed your currently held Ships.
