You represent the Yengii Society.

Your Species Mechanics and Rules Constraints are shown below:

Bid Tiebreaker: 5.
  - explanation: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
Colony Support: 3.
  - explanation: Check your Colony Support at the beginning of the Economy Phase. If you have more colonies than your Colony Support, you must discard the excess under the colony deck.

Secretive:
When the Yengii invent a technology, they do not share it. The other players cannot use the technology to play cards.
  - Benefit: When other players invent technologies, the Yengii benefit as normal.
  - Reduced Sharing Bonus: Since the Yengii aren't using their technologies to lay the foundation of the Confluence, they gain a reduced Sharing Bonus.
  - Placement: When the Yengii invent a technology, they should flip it as normal, but not place it in the center of the play area with the other invented technologies. Instead, they should keep them splayed in front of themselves.
  - Tiebreaking Exception: Invented technologies do not count against the Yengii for determining their research team bid tiebreaking.

Licensing:
The Yengii may, as part of a trade, license a technology by allowing another player to play a card as if they had a technology the Yengii invented.
  - Effect: The recipient finds their matching card and puts it into play permanently.
  - Speed: The Yengii can license a technology during the same Trade Phase they invented it, effectively "sharing" it faster than is possible for the other species.
  - Constraint: This ability cannot be used to bring back a card that was hidden under another card.
