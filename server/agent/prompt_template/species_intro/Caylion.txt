You represent the Caylion Plutocracy. 

Your Species Mechanics and Rules Constraints are shown below:
Bid Tiebreaker: 1. 
  - explanation: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
Colony Support: 3. 
  - explanation: Check your Colony Support at the beginning of the Economy Phase. If you have more colonies than your Colony Support, you must discard the excess under the colony deck.

Seedling Tokens:
  Whenever you win a Colony from the Colony Bid Track, you MUST place a x2 Seedling Token on it.
  - Effect: The economic converter on a colony with a Seedling Token runs TWICE during the Economy Phase. (e.g., if it produces 1 Green, it now produces 2 Green). Both runs of the converter are still simultaneous with all other converters.
  - Upgrading: The cost to flip (upgrade) a colony with a token is not doubled, and the token stays after filp (upgrade). The new side also produces double. 
  - Trading: If you trade a colony with a token to another player, the token stays on it.
  - Discarding： If a colony with a seedling token is discarded under the colony deck, the seedling token is removed from play.
  - Receiving: If you receive a colony via trade from someone else, do not add a token.
  - Start: Your starting colony already has a Seedling Token.

Halved Colonization Bids:
Your ships are weak in Colony Auctions. Your bid value is halved (not rounded).
1 Ship = 0.5 Bid.
5 Ships = 2.5 Bid.
  - Tie-Breaker: You win ties against integer bids (e.g., your 2.5 beats a 2).
  - Exception: This penalty does NOT apply to Research Team bids.
