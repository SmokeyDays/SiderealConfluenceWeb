# Caylion:

## Upgrading the Caylion Economy:
Some starting Caylion cards have upgrade converters that produce a victory point and a yellow resource. 
Since these converters are run during the Trade Phase, the yellow they produce may immediately be traded away.



## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
Your colonies are extremely valuable and extremely expensive. You'll want to bid five ships on colonies every turn for the first three turns to ensure that you don't delay colonization. To do this, you'll need to trade for ships from other players.

Be willing to trade your colonies to other players - a good deal in the early game is three times what it produces. An excellent trade is to offer one of your colonies in exchange for a jungle colony and some resources. You can spend the jungle colony to upgrade one of your starting cards.

Never upgrade your starting cards with worlds you colonized - they were far too expensive for you to spend in such a minor way. Instead, trade for jungle colonies from other players.

Upgrade any colonies with seedling tokens as quickly as possible. If you have a choice during the Colony Bid, try to focus your colonies on all producing the same type of resource once upgraded. This will make inventing technologies that cost that resource very easy.




# Eni:

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
Look at the other players economies and resources. If a player has enough resources to run one of your interest converters, try to trade it to them. If they have almost enough, see if you can make a three-way trade with someone else in order to get that player both the converter and the resources to run it. In general, you can loan converters for half of their net output.

Universal Applied Metaethics — a converter you start with — is one of the better point producing converters in the game. If octagons aren't too expensive in your game, try to run this frequently. Since the white resources it produces are donations, you'll need to trade with players to get them back.

If you allow a single player to use most of your converters every turn, that player will win. Try to spread the wealth around. The richer the whole game is, the better you will do.

In a game without the Eni Et, players who hoard resources between turns to save for invention have lost some of their economic potential. Your interest converters let players save resources while still making a profit on them. Furthermore, you may be able to convince players to delay invention for a turn and run a big interest converter instead — they'll be able to invent two technologies later instead of one now, and you make yet more profit.

Interest converters can be upgraded to produce victory points, but those points can't be traded back to you. Delay those upgrades until the late game, when points are more valuable than resources and players can afford to trade for the use of your cards.

If you're having a hard time loaning your interest converters, see if you can get the resources needed for the input. You can't run the converter yourself, but it shouldn't cost more than a small cube to get someone else to do it for you.



# Faderan:

## Specific Relic World Effects:
You have access to unique cards with specific effects:
  - Automated Transport Network: When played, take two Colonies from the top of the Colony deck. It grants the holder 2 additional colony support. If the Im'dril have this, they may use it to hold colonies into the Economy Phase.
  - Star's Ruin: When played, gain 2 points, plus the number of points of the current Invention Bonus.
  - Nalgorian Grindstone: To run this converter, the player who has it must return 1 point to the common pool. If the player has no points, they may not run it.
  - Transmutive Decomposer: Cannot accept ships as input that were produced by another converter during the same Economy Phase.
  - Gift of the Duruntai: The first time it is traded to a player each turn, it gives the player listed resources and the Faderan gain 1 Biotechnology. Trading it a second time in the same turn gains no one any resources. It does not return to the Faderan at the end of the turn.
  - Contextual Integrator Cache: When played, count the number of Acknowledgements non-Faderan players hold. The Faderan gain 1 point for every 3 such Acknowledgements, rounded up.
  - Paradise Converter: The converter on this card lets the holder exchange 1 Colony of any climate for 2 points. The Colony is discarded. Run at most once per turn.
  - Relic Detector: Has an additional converter for drawing cards from the Relic World deck during the Trade Phase (Discard 1 Colony and spend 3 food -> Draw 1 Relic World). This converter and the one on the back of the Relic World deck may be run in the same turn.

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
Giving another player a small or large cube in exchange for accepting an Acknowledgement is a fair price in the mid-game. Avoid paying players to accept Acknowledgements for the first two turns — it is more important to invest in your economy and relic worlds. If someone wins a bid for a tech, offer them a cube towards that invention in return for accepting an Acknowledgement. They invent for cheaper; you share in the points, and it costs them nothing (outside of acknowledging your help).

On the last turn, trade becomes more difficult because players can't trade victory points. Your ability to hand out Acknowledgements is a partial solution; anyone can pay you a victory point easily. Use this to make late game trades more fluid when you are involved.

Relic worlds are more powerful if you gain them early in the game; it is rarely worth it to play one on the last turn. Expect to get two to three out during your game. Faderan strategy is about adapting to your Relic Worlds. Try to get them out as early as possible during a Trade Phase to give you more time to adapt. Otherwise, you'll find yourself scrambling to get needed resources near the end of trading, when everyone else is happy with what they have and overcharging.

The Faderan can get blocked from their primary strategies and need to pivot. If the other players don't understand the value of Acknowledgements and refuse to accept them, instead focus more on your economy and inventing technologies (and use Acknowledgements on the last turn to streamline trading). If you can't find ice worlds to spend for relic worlds, pour your excess white into Ritual Government to be reliably wealthy instead.



# Im

## No Colonies:
The Im'dril do not have colony support.
  - Bidding: They may bid on colonies, but would need to trade them away as they can't use them.
  - Discard Rule: If the Im'dril hold any colonies at the beginning of the Economy Phase, they must discard them to the bottom of the colony deck.

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
The Im'dril have the strongest economic potential in the game — if you can completely turn on their economy you will do extremely well. It will take you about nine turns to do this, but the game is only six turns long. The solution is to go massively into debt to the other players to get the resources you need to turn on your economy. Trade for resources this turn and pay for them next turn. Your economy is strong enough that you can afford a substantial mark-up: as much as five small cubes next turn for a single octagon right now.

On the first turn of the game, try to run two of your three most valuable converters: Galactic Exploration, Microgravity Assembly, and Faderan Relic Caches. To do this, you'll need to discover (play) a fleet with at least two support. You will need to unlock additional fleets as you grow your economy. As fleets are expensive, try to get them to enter play at the last moment, just as you need them.

Without colonies, the Im'dril economy is quite fragile: it can't recover if you spend most of your resources on technologies. Avoid inventing technologies until turn four. Instead, use those resources to continue speeding up your economy.




#Kit

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
It is imperative that the Kit run Expansive Social Diffusion frequently, especially in the early game. It is the starting converter which requires five green as input.

Many nullspace colonies cost one yellow to put into play. If you trade these for more than one yellow (say, a yellow and a small cube), you make a profit for nearly no cost to yourself. Since nullspace colonies are played during the Trade Phase, you can offer a colony to a player. If they accept the deal you can then play and trade them that colony.

If the other players aren't interested in trading for your nullspace colonies, you can invest in them to improve your economy. Just make sure you can run any new colonies the turn they enter play. Similarly, if you can't get five green on the first turn to run Expansive Social Diffusion, you can pivot into collecting yellow to get as many nullspace colonies as possible. They'll add up to a significant additional income over the game.

If a player is about to spend a colony to upgrade or play a card, offer to trade for that colony for one of your nullspace colonies and a small cube or ship. They profit the small cube or ship. You lose a yellow (to play the nullspace colony) and whatever you pay them. For the rest of the game, you gain the output of the colony they would have spent.




# Kjasjavikalimm

## Expansionist:
When setting up the game, the Kjasjavikalimm count twice towards the number of players for the colony bid track. (Ex: A 5 player game would be considered a 6 player game). This ensures there are more colonies available in the auction.

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
You need very many colonies to play and flip your territory tiles. If you can manage to purchase colonies from other players, do so. The Kt'Zr'Kt'Rtl are a good source of relatively cheap colonies that you can use to play and upgrade territories. Other players may also be willing to trade colonies. Never play or flip a tile unless you can immediately make full use of its economic converters.

Spending colonies to play an unproductive tile is effectively throwing those colonies away for no gain. You are not expected to get every territory tile into play by the end of the game.





# Unity

### Immunity: Wild resources are immune to Zeth stealing. Do not avoid running most of your economy to make yourself "protected" — buying protection from the Zeth is usually much cheaper.

## Flexible Colonization:
Several Unity cards may be flipped or played by consuming a colony of any climate and spending some resources.
  - Constraint: Unity can only support 1 colony.
  - Strategy: You can colonize a second, but you will need to trade or consume it. Otherwise, you'll have to discard it to the bottom of the deck as you enter the Economy Phase.

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
For everyone else, the Economy Phase is about becoming rich and the Trade Phase is for fixing the colors of resources. For you, your economy fixes the colors of resources, so you must use the Trade Phase to become rich. Always trade your resource (wild or not) at a profit, but the profit can be small. Trade a large for two small or a small for a large.

Your economy can run on anything. Make sure the other players know that you want their "junk". Don't worry about getting the correct mix of large and small cubes: you can play Computer Worlds to adapt to the resources you have. Aim to get about two Computer Worlds out in the first three turns, but don't worry about getting them all out.

Since you can ignore your own economy during the Trade Phase, you'll have attention to spare. Look for players who need a few cubes to run a converter or invent something, then offer those cubes before they even ask. If anyone has leftover resources or unused converters at the end of a Trade Phase, see if you can fix that. The other players often won't be able to pay you immediately: accept payment next turn with a 50% mark-up.




# Yengii

## Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
Starting on turn two or so, invent one to three technologies that consume resources that are generally plentiful in the game, produce resources that are generally in demand, or can be used to upgrade the other players' starting cards. Ideally all three. Then, try to license those technologies to as many players as possible, in as few turns as possible. In general, if you license each technology to at least three players for about two small cubes apiece, you are doing well.

You may be able to convince people to help you invent a technology in exchange for the license of that technology. For example, if you can convince four players to each give you two small cubes towards inventing an era I technology (in exchange for the license), you'll make a net profit of two small cubes, in addition to the few points for inventing it.

Once you enter the mid game, start saving up resources and improving your economy until you can invent a few really expensive technologies on the last turn. At the same time, run converters that produce victory points as frequently as possible. Yengii are wealthier than most of the other species, but have a hard time turning that wealth into points.
