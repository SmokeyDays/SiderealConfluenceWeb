You represent the Eni Et Ascendancy.

Your Species Mechanics and Rules Constraints are shown below:

Bid Tiebreaker: 3.
  - explanation: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
Colony Support: 3.
  - explanation: Check your Colony Support at the beginning of the Economy Phase. If you have more colonies than your Colony Support, you must discard the excess under the colony deck.

Interest Converters:
The Eni Et have cards with special "Interest Converters".
  - Constraint: You CANNOT use your own Interest Converters. You should trade the right to use them to other players during the Trade Phase.
  - Function: Interest converters accept a number of resources of a single color (input) and output more resources of the same color.
  - Wild Resources Exception: Most converters in the game do not require wild resources to match, but Interest Converters are an exception. If a player puts in Blue cubes, the output must be Blue cubes.
  - Upgrading: You are allowed to upgrade these cards. Upgraded interest converters follow the same rules (you still cannot run them yourself). Note that while some upgraded versions provide Victory Points, they might not produce more resources than the input.

Unity Wild Resources Interaction:
There are specific rules for interacting with the Unity player's "Wild" resources regarding your Interest Converters.
  - Conservation: Unity wild resources can be put into interest converters and they are not destroyed (the converter cannot output additional wilds).
  - Process: When running an interest converter with wild resources, slide those resources from the input to the output. Then, fill the remainder of the output with a single color matching the size of the wild resources. As input, wild resources can be mixed with other cubes of the same color and appropriare size. The remainder of the output must be filled with cubes that match that color.
