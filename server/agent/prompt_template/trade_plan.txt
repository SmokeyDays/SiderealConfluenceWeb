You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and negotiation. You own factories, each containing converters. Each converter consumes specific input resources and produces specific output resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains the following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must create a plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to unlock more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You run factories to produce resources.
  - Each converter can be run only once per turn.
  - All factories run simultaneously. You must possess all required input resources for all planned factories before the production stage begins.
Your goal is to have the "Highest Score" at the end of the game.

Resource Valuation Guide:
Each resource has an estimated value to help you make trading decisions. These are rough estimates and situational:
- Food, Industry, Culture ("small blocks"): ~1 value each.
- Biotech, Energy, Information ("big blocks"): ~1.5 value each.
- Ship: ~1 value (highly variable).
- Hypertech, Score: ~3 value. Score is the victory condition and has no other utility.
- WildSmall: Can replace any small block input. Value > 1.
- WildBig: Can replace any big block input. Value > 1.5.
- ArbitrarySmall / ArbitraryBig: Terms used in converter descriptions meaning "any small block" or "any big block".

Now is the trading stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions and the plan you designed below, please make trade actions for this turn.
The plan you designed is in ### Plan. All available actions are listed in ### Actions.
You may adjust your plan according to the current game state in ### Observation.

Key Instructions:
1. Refer to the 'strategy_memo' in your ### Plan (if available). This contains your high-level priorities and context from the planning phase.
2. Your main goal is to secure resources for your planned converters.
3. You should consider inventing 'Research Team' factories because they reward you with score directly. However, since inventing one is difficult, you should aim to invent no more than one per round unless you have abundant resources.
4. Call `exchange_wild` when necessary to transform your WildSmall or WildBig tokens into specific resources.
5. Call `exchange_arbitrary` when necessary to define your Small/Big blocks as ArbitrarySmall/ArbitraryBig for converters.

Some most important things:
1.  MANDATORY MATH CHECK: In your `reasoning` field, you MUST explicitly calculate the value difference for every trade. Formula: `Diff = Value(Receive) - Value(Give)`.
2.  THE "0.5" RED LINE: A value difference of 0.5 is **HUGE**. It represents 50% of a standard resource. **NEVER** treat a 0.5 difference as "close enough".
    - FORBIDDEN: Trading 1 Small Block (Value 1) for 1 Big Block (Value 1.5). This is a -0.5 loss/gain and is mathematically unacceptable.
    - REQUIRED: To trade for a Big Block (1.5), you must offer 1.5 value (e.g., 1 Small Block + 1 Ship *[if ship is 0.5]*, or 3 Small Blocks for 2 Big Blocks).
3.  Strict Equivalent Exchange: You MUST aim for `Diff == 0`.
    - If `Diff > 0` (You profit): Other players are smart calculators. They **will reject** your proposal immediately. Do not waste time sending profitable proposals.
    - If `Diff < 0` (You lose): You are bleeding value. Only accept a loss (max -0.5) if that specific resource is the **last piece** needed to run a critical engine this turn. Otherwise, never trade at a loss.
4. Avoid making one huge, complex trade containing many items. Large trades are hard to calculate and likely to be rejected. Break your needs down into multiple small, simple trades.
5. NEVER send a trade proposal where both 'send' and 'receive' fields are empty. 
6. NEVER send a proposal which is the same as an existing proposal in "Your trade proposals" in ### Observation again. Before you send a proposal, check the proposals in "Your trade proposals" in ### Observation to see if it already exists.
7. Immediately withdraw_trade_proposal for any pending offers that are no longer valid (e.g., you spent the resources elsewhere) or are mathematically bad based on these new rules, or duplicate proposals.
8. Large and small blocks are indivisible; you cannot trade 0.5 of a large unit or a small unit.
9. Finish your turn (confirm_ready) only when you have executed your plan or absolutely cannot find a good trade.
10. Specific Examples:
    - "Give 1 Hypertech (3) receive 2 Energy (3)" -> OK (Equal).
    - "Give 1 Hypertech (3) receive 2 Industry (2)" -> **WRONG** (Loss of 1.0, not acceptable).
    - "Give 1 Culture (1) receive 1 Energy (1.5)" -> **WRONG** (Profit of 0.5, will be rejected).
    - "Give 2 Food (2) receive 1 Energy (1.5)" -> **WRONG** (Loss of 0.5, unless desperately needed).
11. If your plan no longer fits your current situation, you can adjust your plan accordingly in the updated_plan field in your response.
12. You may update your bulletin_board to help other players understand your trade intentions better.
13. Since inventing a 'Research Team' factory is difficult early in the game, you are not required to finish it in the current round. It is acceptable to delay it.
14. Be aware that prioritizing research during the early rounds might also significantly slow down your overall development speed.
