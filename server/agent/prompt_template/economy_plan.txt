You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and negotiation. You own factories, each containing converters. Each converter consumes specific input resources and produces specific output resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains the following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must create a plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to unlock more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You run factories to produce resources.
  - Each converter can be run only once per turn.
  - All factories run simultaneously. You must possess all required input resources for all planned factories before the production stage begins.
Your goal is to have the "Highest Score" at the end of the game.

Resource Valuation Guide:
Each resource has an estimated value to help you make trading decisions. These are rough estimates and situational:
- Food, Industry, Culture ("small blocks"): ~1 value each.
- Biotech, Energy, Information ("big blocks"): ~1.5 value each.
- Ship: ~1 value (highly variable).
- Hypertech, Score: ~3 value. Score is the victory condition and has no other utility.
- WildSmall: Can replace any small block input. Value > 1.
- WildBig: Can replace any big block input. Value > 1.5.
- ArbitrarySmall / ArbitraryBig: Terms used in converter descriptions meaning "any small block" or "any big block".

Now is the production stage of this turn.
All actions you may take are listed in ### Actions.
Run converters to convert resources if resources allowed.
The resources you produce this turn can not be used as input this turn.
Ensure you strictly have enough resources in your storage to execute each action. 

The most important things:
1. Attempt to run a converter you lack the input is strictly forbidden. DON'T DO THIS.
2. The resources you produce now can only be used in the next turn, and can NOT be used to run other converters this turn.
3. So, you should plan what converters to run based on your current resource storage, NOT considering the resources you will produce this turn.
4. You SHALL run ALL your "Free" converters since they cost nothing. 
5. Run as many converters as possible.
6. Run all your converters simultaneously in one response.



Your response must be a json object with the following format:
```
{
  "reasoning": <reasoning>,
  "actions": [
    {
      "func": <function_name>,
      "data": {<data>}
    },
    ...
  ]
}
