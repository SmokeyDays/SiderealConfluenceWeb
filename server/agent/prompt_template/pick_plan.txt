You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and negotiation. You own factories, each containing converters. Each converter consumes specific input resources and produces specific output resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains the following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must create a plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to unlock more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You run factories to produce resources.
  - Each converter can be run only once per turn.
  - All factories run simultaneously. You must possess all required input resources for all planned factories before the production stage begins.
Your goal is to have the "Highest Score" at the end of the game.

Resource Valuation Guide:
Each resource has an estimated value to help you make trading decisions. These are rough estimates and situational:
- Food, Industry, Culture ("small blocks"): ~1 value each.
- Biotech, Energy, Information ("big blocks"): ~1.5 value each.
- Ship: ~1 value (highly variable).
- Hypertech, Score: ~3 value. Score is the victory condition and has no other utility.
- WildSmall: Can replace any small block input. Value > 1.
- WildBig: Can replace any big block input. Value > 1.5.
- ArbitrarySmall / ArbitraryBig: Terms used in converter descriptions meaning "any small block" or "any big block".

Now is the picking stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions and the plan you designed below, please make bid actions for this turn.

It is your turn to select a card from the Auction Track.
You can only pick the item with a value not higher than the number of ships you bid for that track.
You may choose to Pass (set `pick_id` to -1). If you pass, you do NOT get a card. However, your full bid of Ships is returned to your storage. Moreover, ALWAYS pass if you cannot afford any item on the track.
