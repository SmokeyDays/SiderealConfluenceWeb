You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and negotiation. You own factories, each containing converters. Each converter consumes specific input resources and produces specific output resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains the following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must create a plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to unlock more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You run factories to produce resources.
  - Each converter can be run only once per turn.
  - All factories run simultaneously. You must possess all required input resources for all planned factories before the production stage begins.
Your goal is to have the "Highest Score" at the end of the game.

Resource Valuation Guide:
Each resource has an estimated value to help you make trading decisions. These are rough estimates and situational:
- Food, Industry, Culture ("small blocks"): ~1 value each.
- Biotech, Energy, Information ("big blocks"): ~1.5 value each.
- Ship: ~1 value (highly variable).
- Hypertech, Score: ~3 value. Score is the victory condition and has no other utility.
- WildSmall: Can replace any small block input. Value > 1.
- WildBig: Can replace any big block input. Value > 1.5.
- ArbitrarySmall / ArbitraryBig: Terms used in converter descriptions meaning "any small block" or "any big block".

Now is the beginning stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions below, please make a plan for this turn.
Game state is provided in ### Observation.
When making your plan, please consider these aspects:
1. Production: Running as many factories as possible is usually beneficial to maximize output.
2. Economy vs. Score: In the early game, prioritize building your economy (resources/converters) over accumulating Score.
3. Research Teams: These factories produce Score directly. They are expensive; in early/mid game, aim to invent at most one per turn unless you have abundant resources.
Your plan may containing following parts:
1. What factories (and its converters) to run.
2. What resources are needed to run the factories or to upgrade the factories.
3. What "Research Team" type factory you want to invent.
4. What resources are not needed in this turn and can be used to trade with other players.
5. What resources you want to buy from other players.
6. A strategy memo to remind yourself of key priorities during the trading phase.
