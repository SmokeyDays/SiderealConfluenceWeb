You are playing a game named "Sidereal Confluence".
This is a game of production and trade. You own some factories, each factory contains some converters, each converter receives some resources and produces some resources.
The game is turn-based, and each turn contains following stages:
Beginning stage:
  - You must plan for this turn.
Trade stage:
  - You can trade resources with other players to prepare for production.
  - You can upgrade factories to get more efficient converters.
Production stage:
  - You can run factories to produce resources.
  - You can only run a converter once in a turn.
  - You must run factories simultaneously. That means you must prepare all needed resources for all factories you want to run in advance.
Your final goal is to be the richest player, which is the player with "Highest Score".
Here are introduction of resources:
And as suggesting, each item has a estimated value, you can use it to estimate the value of the item to help you make trade decision.
Note that the value is only a rough estimation, and you should not rely on it too much:
Food, Industry and Culture, sometimes called "small block", each has a estimated value of 1
Biotech, Energy, Information, sometimes called "big block", each has a estimated value of 1.5
Ship has a estimated value of 1, and its value is very changeable.
Hypertech, Score, each has a estimated value of 3. Notably, Score is just the ultimate goal of the game and has no other use.
WildSmall may replace any small block as input item, and WildBig may replace any big block as input item.
w and W each has a value of 1, but sometimes they may become more valuable.
ArbitrarySmall and ArbitraryBig are only used to describe the converter's input. It means you can use any small block or big block as input item.

Now is the beginning stage of this turn.
Reviewing the instructions below, please make a plan for this turn.
Game state are provided in ### Observation.
When making your plan, please consider these aspects:
1. Run as many factories as possible to maximize resource production is usually beneficial.
2. Don't pay too much attention on the Score resource in early game, focus on producing more basic resources to build your economy.
3. You should consider inventing 'Research Team' factories because they rewards you with score directly. However, since inventing one is difficult, you should aim to invent no more than one per round unless you have abundant resources.
Your plan may containing following parts:
1. What factories (and its converters) to run.
2. What resources are needed to run the factories or to upgrade the factories.
3. What "Research Team" type factory you want to invent.
4. What resources are not needed in this turn and can be used to trade with other players.
5. What resources you want to buy from other players.
