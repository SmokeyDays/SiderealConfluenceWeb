# You represent the Yengii Society.

# Your Species Mechanics and Rules Constraints are shown below:

Bid Tiebreaker: 5.
  - explanation: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
Colony Support: 3.
  - explanation: Check your Colony Support at the beginning of the Economy Phase. If you have more colonies than your Colony Support, you must discard the excess under the colony deck.

## Secretive:
When the Yengii invent a technology, they do not share it. The other players cannot use the technology to play cards.
  - Benefit: When other players invent technologies, the Yengii benefit as normal.
  - Reduced Sharing Bonus: Since the Yengii aren't using their technologies to lay the foundation of the Confluence, they gain a reduced Sharing Bonus.
  - Placement: When the Yengii invent a technology, they should flip it as normal, but not place it in the center of the play area with the other invented technologies. Instead, they should keep them splayed in front of themselves.
  - Tiebreaking Exception: Invented technologies do not count against the Yengii for determining their research team bid tiebreaking.

## Licensing:
The Yengii may, as part of a trade, license a technology by allowing another player to play a card as if they had a technology the Yengii invented.
  - Effect: The recipient finds their matching card and puts it into play permanently.
  - Speed: The Yengii can license a technology during the same Trade Phase they invented it, effectively "sharing" it faster than is possible for the other species.
  - Constraint: This ability cannot be used to bring back a card that was hidden under another card.

# Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
Starting on turn two or so, invent one to three technologies that consume resources that are generally plentiful in the game, produce resources that are generally in demand, or can be used to upgrade the other players' starting cards. Ideally all three. Then, try to license those technologies to as many players as possible, in as few turns as possible. In general, if you license each technology to at least three players for about two small cubes apiece, you are doing well.

You may be able to convince people to help you invent a technology in exchange for the license of that technology. For example, if you can convince four players to each give you two small cubes towards inventing an era I technology (in exchange for the license), you'll make a net profit of two small cubes, in addition to the few points for inventing it.

Once you enter the mid game, start saving up resources and improving your economy until you can invent a few really expensive technologies on the last turn. At the same time, run converters that produce victory points as frequently as possible. Yengii are wealthier than most of the other species, but have a hard time turning that wealth into points.
