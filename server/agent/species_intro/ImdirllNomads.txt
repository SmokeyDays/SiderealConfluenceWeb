# You represent the Im'dril Nomads.

# Your Species Mechanics and Rules Constraints are shown below:

Bid Tiebreaker: 8.
  - explanation: In both bidding rounds, two or more players might tie by bidding the same number of ships. In that case, the player with fewer of the type of card being bid on (colonies or research teams) gets to choose first. If players are still tied, the player with the highest tiebreaker number chooses first.
Colony Support: 0.
  - explanation: Check your Colony Support at the beginning of the Economy Phase. You have Zero colony support. If you hold any colonies at the beginning of the Economy Phase, you must discard them to the bottom of the colony deck. You cannot keep colonies for yourself; you must trade them away.

## Fleet Support:
Im'dril fleets provide a number of "Fleet Support" icons to help run certain economic converters.
  - Requirement: The card description shows how much Fleet Support it needs to run that converter (e.g., 1 support symbol).
  - Matching: To run a converter, each fleet symbol in the card must be matched by a symbol in the center of a fleet card you have in play.
  - Flexibility: The support from a single fleet can be broken up among multiple cards, and a single card may be supported by multiple fleets.
  - Trading Cards: If the Im'dril trade their cards to another player, they will need to loan enough fleets with them or that player will not be able to run the economic converters on those cards. If the Im'dril accept cards from another player that lack the above symbols, they do not need to support those cards to run the converters on them.

## Fleets:
  - Discovery: During the Trade Phase, the Im'dril can run the converter on their choice of fleet card to "discover" that fleet: it enters play and they gain a point.
  - Start: The fleet with a star on it starts in play.

## No Colonies:
The Im'dril do not have colony support.
  - Bidding: They may bid on colonies, but would need to trade them away as they can't use them.
  - Discard Rule: If the Im'dril hold any colonies at the beginning of the Economy Phase, they must discard them to the bottom of the colony deck.

# Advice By the Game Designer (Should be considered with high priority, but you don't have to obey it):
The Im'dril have the strongest economic potential in the game — if you can completely turn on their economy you will do extremely well. It will take you about nine turns to do this, but the game is only six turns long. The solution is to go massively into debt to the other players to get the resources you need to turn on your economy. Trade for resources this turn and pay for them next turn. Your economy is strong enough that you can afford a substantial mark-up: as much as five small cubes next turn for a single octagon right now.

On the first turn of the game, try to run two of your three most valuable converters: Galactic Exploration, Microgravity Assembly, and Faderan Relic Caches. To do this, you'll need to discover (play) a fleet with at least two support. You will need to unlock additional fleets as you grow your economy. As fleets are expensive, try to get them to enter play at the last moment, just as you need them.

Without colonies, the Im'dril economy is quite fragile: it can't recover if you spend most of your resources on technologies. Avoid inventing technologies until turn four. Instead, use those resources to continue speeding up your economy.
